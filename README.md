# Course Description
> This course will teach students to think critically about data and their assemblages. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical and political implications of data via a number of contemporary issues. Students will learn that they are data subjects and datafied, they have a data double, leave behind data shadows, statistical agencies try to re-create them as a data person, data socially shape them, they may be domesticated by data, that they may be governed by a dataism ideology and that they may be in the midst of a data revolution.

> In this course students will define what data are, examine the power of data, and explore how data are used, who owns them, and once data are linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps and infographics, students will assess if these determine actions and material outcomes.  Students will learn to conceptualize data technically, philosophically, ethically, in the political economy, institutionally and in time and space. In short, students will learn how to think critically about data.

 # Course Objectives
* Distinguish big data from small data, and recognize different types of data;
* conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;
* Identify data politics and critically read data policies; and
* Think about data-based knowledge, the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

### Final Project Wikipedia Entry

You will create a Wikipedia Encyclopaedia entry on a concept, topic, indicator project, a dataset, etc. selected from the readings and/or discussed in-class. The Wikipedia class URL is [here.](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/Journalism_and_Communication,_Carleton_University/COMS4407_Critical_Data_Studies_(Fall_2016)?enroll=hcplvzda.)I will give you the assigned code. On that page you will find a breakdown of activities per week. You will have to create a Wikipedia account, you will have to connect that account to this page, you will have to create a sandbox, add content to that sandbox, you will have to appoint 3 peer reviewers to your article, and you will have to move that content once it is ready into the Wikipedia main pages.  You will have to go through the weekly exercises.  Because you are now producing public knowledge, you will have to be very attentive to Wikipedia protocols. Once your article is public, others will be able to edit the content as in any Wikipedia article.

Every week you have an activity that will guide you toward the successful completion of your final project.  Consider the process a project management approach to your success.**_Just doing these gives you 10%._** 
In class I will give you an [Editing Wikipedia guide](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Editing_Wikipedia_brochure_%28Wiki_Education_Foundation%29_%282016%29.pdf) sent to me by the Wikipedia Foundation. Follow weekly exercises.

#### Final Exam (20%):
It will be held between December 9 – 22 and will include a combination of multiple choice questions, short answer questions about concepts, topics, and issues, and 1 essay question. Exams cannot be deferred or rescheduled to accommodate travel plans.

#### Late Policy
Extensions must be requested in advance, in person, and will typically require documentation of an extended illness or other significant disruption to your ability to complete the required work.

#### NOTE

* Readings - it is best to read these before class, this is a 4th year seminar and readings inform discussion.

* In-Class discussion - datasets, portals, indicators, reports or resources - do not need to be read before class. You will however want to have copies of these on your electronic devices as we will do in-class exercises that relate to these. Being familiar with them is a good thing though!

 ## Week 1 (Sept.8) – Introduction
Welcome to the class! We will get to know each other, go over the course outline, class deliverables, learning objectives and do an in-class database reading exercise. Students will learn to differentiate data, datasets, databases and metadata and discuss the production of knowledge and facts?

**Datasets for in-class exercise:**

* [The Counted](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database)

### Assignment 1- Data Description (Due @ noon Sept. 15) (10 %) 3 pages:
Look for a CANADIAN dataset related to police shootings, homicides, crime, or gun ownership, etc. Take into consideration the in-class dataset exercise and describe the dataset. Also, write a brief assessment of this dataset. The following is a list of ideas to help you do so, but do not limit yourselves to these: Are there any potential biases? What are the methodological strengths and limitations of this dataset? What is not being measured? Could these data be used to inform public policy? If you were to use them would you include any cautionary notes? Do you trust these data? Find a news article that refers to these data and consider whether or not the article accurately reported the issue. This is descriptive precise writing, this is not an essay, think of it as a data-based annotated bibliography.

## Week 2 (Sept. 15) – Conceptualizing data?
This week, students sharpen their critical abilities to read a dataset and to conceptually frame them.  Students will learn about framing data, methodological approaches to the study of data and define critical data studies.  In-class students will examine the datasets below, those examined last week and the datasets you discovered for your assignment, to provide context and help ground theory. In-class students will form into 5 groups to study the 5 datasets below.

### Readings:

## Week 3 (Sept. 22) – Open Data & Indicators
This week students will examine open data, linked data, the role of the private sector and open data, open data portals, licences and the role of data advocacy.  We will also discuss the role of comparative indicators as a form of legitimizing discourse.  In class students will compare and contrast the Federal, the Ontario and a city data portal.  Students will be able to: distinguish open and closed data, describe and identify data portals, and will begin to understand that open data are situated within a new managerialism discursive regime, democratic ideals, and technology policy that is government, private sector and citizen led. For the last hour of the class a guest expert will discuss the real world of open data.

Evaluate this portal according to the [_Open Data Index definition and scoring methodology_](http://index.okfn.org/methodology/).  The Open Knowledge Foundation evaluates 15 dataset types according to 9 criteria.  Read the methodological guide carefully.  Select **_one of Index’s 15 dataset types_** from your portal and evaluate that dataset against the 9 open data criteria.  If you go to the [Download Page](http://index.okfn.org/download/) you will find useful CSV files to help you, especially the Datasets.csv and the Questions.csv files.  Be sure to explore the Index’s website to see how different Places are reported, The Dataset Overview and read the Insights.  Report your assessment in a table, describe the overall results and how you came to concluded the openness of your dataset.  Finally, critically discuss the Index as a system. For example, was anything ambiguous, did you find what you were looking for, what do you think about this way of evaluating and reviewing data, the nature of the question, how data are framed, is this process objective and fair? What would you improve? What was missing?

 #### Week 5 (Oct. 6) - The Characteristics of Big Data
To date in-class students have mostly discussed small data. This week students will learn what constitutes big data, and how to define and distinguish big data from small data. In addition, students will study the nature of big data, the characteristics of survey data, administrative data and big data and unpack the ontological traits of a number of datasets.  We will also discuss the role of experts, think tanks, and consulting firms in the shaping of big data discourse with an in-class led critical reading of 2 big data reports.

## Week 6 (Oct. 13) – The Enablers of Big Data.
This week students will learn to think historically by examining the enablers of big data. We will do a high level genealogy of the technologies associated with the emergence of big data especially networks, systems, devices and sensors, social media and a variety of methods to collect data. By doing so students will learn that data and technological ‘revolutions’ do not come from no-where, they are evolutionary and they are socio-technological artifacts. In-class we will examine how the state of Massachusetts is strategically positioning itself as the big data centre of power in the US, by studying 2 key reports 1 spearheaded by the Governor’s Office and the other by an industry association.

#### Assignment 3: Critical Definition of Big Data Assignment (Due Week 8 @ noon Nov. 3) (10 %) 3 pages:
Last week, we critically discussed the Government of Ireland’s big data skills report. Keeping that discussion in mind, you are asked to compare and contrast how the MASSTech and the MASS TLC reports define big data.  Are they the same or different and if so how? Be attentive to: authors, what is their organizational affiliation, how were they selected, what are their credentials, who sponsored them, what is the mandate of the sponsoring organization, was there an advisory board, and if so who is on it, why was this study undertaken, was the definition research informed and if so what other works are referenced. Why do you think the definition matters and if it does how does it relate to the enablers of big data.

#### WIKIPEDIA 6
Expand your draft, read peer review instructions, and assign peer reviewers.

## Week 7 (Oct. 20) – Data Science & Data Analytics
You have been building your data knowledge, you have learned how to distinguish big and small data and their ontological characteristics, and we studied the enablers of big data. This week students investigate big data techniques which will be we discussed in a predictive policing context. We will also recall the data discussions of weeks 1 and 2. We will also have a guest speaker from the Ottawa Police Service that does crime mapping and predictive policing.

## Week 9 (Nov. 10) – Data Brokers and Credit Scoring
Welcome back! Big data are alive and well in media industries and data brokerage firms.  This week we will examine the political economy of data by examining types of data services, data products, laws, oversight, regulation and associated issues such as privacy, the corporate use of open data for private sector gain, how data get bundled up and re-sold and how data about you and I get bought and sold and in the hands of corporations with whom we have no relationship. The in-class discussion will focus on data brokerage in the context of credit scores. We will have a guest speaker who is an expert on Credit Scoring, Sports Analytics and Open Data in a private sector context.

## Week 11 (Nov. 24) – The End of Science?
Many enthusiasts suggest that science as we know it is obsolete, as we can now rely on big data and data driven science.  Does this mark a new positivist era, where the sexiest job is that of a data scientists, an era of prediction, super forecasting and fortune telling based on algorithms and terrabytes of unstructured data?  This week we will examine how some areas of science are changing and why data driven science answers some questions and not others.
